            <div class="park-text-body">
                In the mid-1890s, Chicago's famous architect and planner Daniel H. Burnham began sketching a magnificent
                park and boulevard system that would link Jackson Park with downtown. As Chief of Construction for the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition">World's Columbian Exposition of
                    1893</a>, Burnham (1846- 1912) had transformed sandy, wind-swept, Jackson
                Park into the glistening White City. After the fair, Burnham began imagining a more beautiful, orderly,
                and functional Chicago. Burnham's vision, including a south lakefront park with a series of manmade
                islands, linear boating harbor, beaches, meadows, and play fields, was published in his seminal 1909
                Plan of Chicago. The Plan included lakefront parkland and five islands off the lakeshore. Unfortunately,
                the five islands were not realized only Island No. 1 was constructed, now known as Northerly Island.<br>
                <br>
                The South Park Commissioners began acquiring property for the new park in 1885, it took time to
                complete. There was land acquisition from private parties and drawn out disputes with the Illinois
                Central Railroad over riparian rights. Pursuant to a City 1919 ordinance, the South Commissioners Park
                came in possession of approximately 60 acres of reclaimed land, the ordinance also granted the City's 10
                acre “East End Park”. Additional property rights and government approvals were finally secured in 1920,
                and voters approved a $20 million bond issue to create the park. The land creation by landfill took
                several years. By the time, the park was named in honor of Daniel Burnham Park in 1927, only the
                northern part of the site had been filled.<br>
                <br>
                During this period, the South Park Commissioners planned for a stadium on the lakefront. In a letter
                dated, August 11, 1919 “The South Park Commissioners of Chicago invite you to enter a limited
                competition for the commission to prepare working plans and specifications for the construction of a
                stadium on the Lake Front”. Their decision, as a committee, was announced December 1, 1919, having
                selected the plans drawn by Holabird and Roche as the best design submitted. By virtue of this award,
                Holabird and Roche were employed to design Soldier Field. The building is “U” shaped, of gray Benedict
                cast stone executed in early Greek style of architecture. Soldier Field was formally dedicated on
                November 27, 1926.<br>
                <br>
                Burnham Park became part of the Chicago Park District, in 1934 by virtue of the Park Consolidation Act.
                In 1933 and 1934, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_of_Progress">Century of
                    Progress</a>, Chicago's second World's Fair took place in Burnham Park. In
                the mid-1930s, the newly created Chicago Park District used federal funds from the Works Progress
                Administration to complete landfill operations and improve Burnham Park, including the naturalistic
                Promontory Point landscape by renowned designer Alfred Caldwell. In 1935, Mayor Edward J. Kelly began
                pursuing the idea of a permanent fair in Burnham Park. To facilitate this, the State passed a bill
                creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority.<br>
                <br>
                In 1939, the Chicago Park District Administration Building, located at the north end of Soldier Field
                was completed. In 2001, Chicago Park District Administration offices were relocated to 541 N. Fairbanks
                Court, and the Park District Administration Building was razed, to make way for the rehabilitation of
                Soldier Field and the transformation of a beautifully landscaped Museum Campus.<br>
                <br>
                The legislation allowed the construction of Merrill C. Meigs Airport in 1946 and the McCormick Place
                convention hall in 1960. The original McCormick Place burned down in 1967, and despite opposition, a new
                facility opened in Burnham Park in 1971. In recent years, Mayor Richard M. Daley's vision for a greener,
                more beautiful Burnham Park has begun taking shape. Sixty acres of asphalt were transformed into a
                landscaped Museum Campus. Moreover, the former Meigs Field has been transformed into a 119 acre park
                with a natural area, known as Northerly Island where park patrons can enjoy a paved all-purpose trail.
                Birders catch glimpses of migrating birds in the fall and spring seasons, while anglers can find the
                perfect fishing spot.
