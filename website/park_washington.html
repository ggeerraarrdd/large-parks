                Park is one of Chicago's most significant historic landscapes. Originally considered the “western
                division”—a 367-acre portion of the enormous 1055-acre South Park—it was connected to the park's
                “eastern division” via a grand boulevard called the Midway Plaisance. In 1881, the South Park
                Commissioners named the western division in honor of George Washington (1732-1799) first president of
                the United States. At the same time, they named the eastern division Jackson Park.<br>
                <br>
                Olmsted and Vaux completed an ambitious plan for South Park in 1871. The plan included a magnificent
                South Open Green-an open meadow on which cows and sheep would roam to enhance the pastoral experience
                and keep the lawn trim. The meadow was not only enjoyed by flocks of Southdown sheep, but also park
                patrons who gathered for baseball, drills, and other athletics. Renowned architects Burnham & Root
                designed two late nineteenth century buildings in the park—the stables and round house and the refectory
                which originally housed the offices for the South park Commissioners. In 1910 Burnham's firm designed a
                larger administrative headquarters which houses the Du Sable Museum of African American History.<br>
                <br>
                In 1922 Lorado Taft (1860-1936), Chicago's pre-eminent sculptor, created the Fountain of Time on the
                southeastern edge of Washington Park. Inspired by ”The Paradox of Time,” a poem by Henry Austin Dobson,
                Taft's fountain is composed of an ominous cloaked Father-Time figure gazing at a wave-like procession of
                one hundred human figures across the water.<br>
                <br>
                By the mid-1930s, the growing African-American community around Washington Park was in dire need of
                additional recreational facilities. The park district responded by building two competition-size
                swimming pools near the refectory. In the early 1990s, the park district rehabilitated the refectory and
                transformed the swimming area into a major aquatic center. Recent projects include lagoon improvements,
                the construction of a $700 thousand playground, the creation of an arboretum, and a $2 million
                restoration of the Fountain of Time. Lagoon improvements were made in the early 2000s.
