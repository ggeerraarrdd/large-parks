            <div class="park-text-body">
                After the state legislature created the South Park Commission in 1869, the renowned designers of New
                York's Central Park, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Law_Olmsted">Frederick Law
                    Olmsted</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvert_Vaux">Calvert Vaux</a>, were hired to
                lay out the 1055-acre park. The South Park Commissioners acquired land for the park from 1869 until 1930
                through multiple sources. Known originally as South Park, the landscape had eastern and western
                divisions connected by a grand boulevard named the Midway Plaisance. The eastern division became known
                as Lake Park; however, in 1880 the commission asked the public to suggest official names for both the
                eastern and western Divisions. Jackson and Washington were proposed, and the following year, Lake Park
                was renamed Jackson Park to honor Andrew Jackson (1767-1845), the seventh president of the United
                States.<br>
                <br>
                In 1890, Chicago won the honor of hosting the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition">World's Columbian
                    Exposition</a>, and Jackson Park was
                selected as its site. Olmsted and Chicago's famous architect and planner <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Burnham">Daniel H. Burnham</a> laid out the
                fairgrounds. A team of the nation's most significant architects and sculptors created the "White City"
                of plaster buildings and artworks. The monumental World's Fair opened to visitors on May 1, 1893. After
                it closed six months later, the site was transformed back into parkland. Jackson Park featured the first
                public golf course west of the Alleghenies, which opened in 1899. In 1934, the park became part of the
                Chicago Park District's portfolio when the 22 park districts were consolidated. Today, two structures
                remain as impressive symbols of the World's Columbian Exposition. The "Golden Lady" sculpture is a
                smaller version of Daniel Chester French's Statue of the Republic which originally stood at the foot of
                the Court of Honor. The original Fine Arts Palace now houses Chicago's <a
