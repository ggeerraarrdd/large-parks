                Located in the East Garfield Park Community, Garfield Park totals 173 acres and features the historic
                Golden Dome field house. The field house holds a gymnasium, auditorium, dance studio, fitness center,
                boxing center, grand ballroom and meeting rooms.<br>
                <br>
                Outside, the park offers a swimming pool, baseball fields, athletic fields for football or soccer, a
                fishing lagoon, tennis courts, floral gardens and playgrounds that were recently renovated as part of
                Mayor Emanuel's Chicago Plays! Program. The park also offers an artifical turf where children can play
                in Owls LaCrosse teams and other park district and community programs. Garfield Park sits adjacent to
                the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_Park_Conservatory">Garfield Park Conservatory</a>, a
                popular destination for special events, educational field trips and
                flower shows.

            <div class="park-text-body">
                In 1869, the Illinois state legislature established the West Park Commission, which was responsible for
                three large parks and interlinking boulevards. This park was first named Central Park in accordance with
                a resolution adopted by the West Park Commission in 1869. The West Park Commissioners acquired property
                for the park from 1870-1932. This was the park name until 1881, when the name was changed to “Garfield
                Park” to honor President James A. Garfield (1831- 1881) after his assassination in 1881. Plans for
                Garfield, Humboldt, and Douglas Parks had been completed ten years earlier, by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Le_Baron_Jenney">William Le Baron Jenney</a>.<br>
                <br>
                Jenney is best known today as the “father of the skyscraper.” His ambitious plans for these three large
                parks could not be realized all at once, Garfield Park was the earliest developed of these three great
                original West Side parks, it was developed in stages, beginning with the east lagoon. The lagoons and a
                unique suspension bridge designed by Jenney remain today. Garfield Park remains the best example of
                Jenney's landscape efforts in Chicago. Some notable components of the park were the first Refectory
                (Casino or Pavilion) Building that was completed and opened to the public in 1884. This was the first
                building of its kind in a park. In 1893, a Pagoda Building was erected, and the first stone bridge was
                constructed over the lagoon connection. In 1906, construction started for replacements for these
                buildings. A Lunch Room in the new Refectory Building opened to the public in 1908. Other recreational
                facilities were also constructed, roque courts, an eight hole golf course, and a bandstand that still
                exists today.<br>
                <br>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Jensen_(landscape_architect)">Jens Jensen</a>, a Danish
                immigrant who began working as a laborer for the West Park System in the 1880's,
                and after a decade, worked his way up to the position of Superintendent of Humboldt Park. At that time,
                the West Park System was entrenched in political graft. In 1900, the commissioners fired Jensen because
                of his efforts to fight the corruption. Five years later, during major political reforms, new
                commissioners appointed him General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect. Deteriorating and
                unfinished sections of the parks allowed Jensen to experiment with his evolving Prairie style. For
                instance, when he took over, each of the three parks had small, poorly maintained conservatories. Rather
                than repairing these structures, which each displayed similar collections, Jensen decided to replace
                them with a single centralized facility. Designed in conjunction with an engineering firm, Hitchings and
                Company, Jensen conceived the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_Park_Conservatory">Garfield Park Conservatory</a> as a
                work of landscape gardening under glass. This Conservatory replaced the one that was built in 1887.
                Jensen's Conservatory was considered revolutionary when it opened to the public in 1908, the form of the
                building emulated a "great Midwestern haystack," while inside the rooms were wonderful compositions of
                water, rock, and plants. The first midwinter Flower Show in the City was held in December 1909 at the
                new Conservatory.<br>
                <br>
                In 1928, the West Park Commission constructed the "Gold Dome Building" in Garfield Park to provide a new
                administrative headquarters for the West Park Commission. Architects, Michaelsen and Rognstad, designed
                the structure. This firm designed other notable park buildings including the Humboldt, Douglas, and
                LaFolette Park Fieldhouses. With the Park Consolidation Act in 1934, Garfield Park became part of the
                Chicago Park District, when the City's 22 independent park commissions merged into a single citywide
                agency. At that time, due to the Park District consolidation the administrative offices were no longer
                needed and the "Gold Dome" building became Garfield Park's fieldhouse.<br>
