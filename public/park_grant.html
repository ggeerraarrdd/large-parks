                Proudly referred to as "Chicago's Front Yard," Grant Park totals 313 acres and is a public park
                located in Chicago's central business district in the Loop Community area. Grant Park's most notable
                features include Maggie Daley Park, <a

                <br>
                Grant Park is home to some of Chicago's most iconic landmarks and attractions. The park includes Museum
                Campus, the site of world-class museums the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural
                History, the Shedd Aquarium and the Adler Planetarium. Grant Park's centerpiece is the Clarence
                Buckingham Memorial Fountain, built in 1927 to provide a monumental focal point while protecting the
                park's breathtaking lakefront views.<br>
                <br>
                Grant Park is also home to baseball diamonds, tennis courts and breathtaking gardens. The park plays
                host to some the city's largest food and music festivals, including <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_of_Chicago">The Taste of Chicago</a> — a large food
                and music festival held around the Independence Day holiday — and The Grant Park Music Festival. Grant
                Park is also the site of the start and finish lines for the <a

                    between Chicago Police and demonstrators during the Democratic National Convention</a>. In 1979,

                History
            </div>
            <div class="park-text-body">
                Grant Park's beginnings date to 1835, when foresighted citizens, fearing commercial lakefront
                development, lobbied to protect the open space. As a result, the park's original area east of Michigan
                Avenue was designated "public ground forever to remain vacant of buildings."<br>
                <br>
                Officially named Lake Park in 1847, the site soon suffered from lakefront erosion. The Illinois Central
                Railroad agreed to build a breakwater to protect the area in exchange for permission for an offshore
                train trestle. After the Great Fire of 1871, the area between the shore and trestle became a dump site
                for piles of charred rubble, the first of many landfill additions.<br>
                <br>
                In 1901, the city transferred the park to the South Park Commission, which named it for Ulysses S. Grant
                (1822-1885), 18th President of the United States. Renowned architect Daniel H. Burnham envisioned Grant
                Park as a formal landscape with museums and civic buildings. However, construction was stalled by
                lawsuits launched by mail-order magnate Aaron Montgomery Ward, who sought to protect the park's open
                character.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, in 1911, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled in Ward's favor. New landfill at the park's southern
                border allowed construction of the Field Museum to begin, and the park evolved slowly. In 1934, the
                South Park Commission was consolidated into the Chicago Park District, which completed improvements
                using federal relief funds.<br>
                <br>
                At the turn of the 21st century, the north end of Grant Park underwent a multi-million-dollar facelift,
                and what was once old railbeds were transformed into Millennium Park, a major landscape and festival
                site."
